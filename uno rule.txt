create global variable for who first player will be, read by an IF statement in a function that will decide the beginning rule

normal number card:

global variable states that the first player will be LEFT of dealer

draw two card:

global variable states that the first player will be LEFT of dealer and must draw two cards and skip their turn

reverse card:

global variable states that the dealer will be the first player and the game will play in the RIGHT direction instead of LEFT

skip card: 

global variable states that the player to the LEFT of dealer is skipped, essentially, the first player is TWO to the LEFT of the dealer

wild card:

global variable states that the first player will be LEFT of dealer and will choose the global color

wild draw 4 card:

global variable states that the first player will be LEFT of dealer and will place card in discard pile and pick another card



LEFT = going down in array
RIGHT = going up in array



**create a function that sets the global color and number/symbol**
