            <p>The key to winning a game of <u><i>BRUNO</i></u>, is by being the first player to play all of the cards in your hand each round.</p>

                            <p>The <u>first player</u> with no cards left in hand is awarded <u>points</u> based on the cards that are still left in each of their opponents' hands.</p>

                            <p>Each player draws a card at the start of the game. The player with the highest card value is designated as the <u>dealer</u>.</p>

                            <p>The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt <u>7 cards</u> from the top of the deck.</p>

                            <p>The remaining cards are placed facedown to and serve as the <u>draw pile</u>.</p>

                            <p>The first card from the top of the draw pile will be the first card of the <u>discard pile</u>.</p>

                            <p>The player to the <u>left of the dealer goes first</u>. Cards must be matched by color, type, or action to be played. Otherwise, the player must draw a card from the <u>draw pile</u>.</p>

                            <p>You must click <i>BRUNO</i> before you play your second to last card. If the next player catches you without saying <i>BRUNO</i>, you must draw 4 more cards from the <u>draw pile</u>.</p>

                            <p>There are 25 cards of each color type (Red, Blue, Green, & Yellow). These cards include numbered cards from 0 to 9 as well as Skip, Reverse, and Draw 2 cards. There are also 4 Wild cards and 4 Wild Draw 4 cards.</p>

                            <p>Scoring for the first player to play every card in their hand:
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                Numbered cards = their face value
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                Draw 2/Reverse/Skip = 20 points
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                Wild/Wild Draw 4 = 20 points
